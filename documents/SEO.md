## Learning of SEO and a Proposal



## Learning
SEO seem to be a concept that is very easy to understanding at first, then it
gets hard, but the more I look into it and use it. It helps me better understand
how a website is chosen/clicked by the users. Applying meta tag to my nuxt
website, I learned that the key of SEO is that it help to make sure the developers understand their own website. Like, choosing the right keywords inside the meta
tag, and to brainstorm the actual demand of the targeted users. By utilizing the
SEO tactic, it also helps the developer re-think on the website's content in the mindset of a user.

One of the key takeaways of the SEO lesson, is that to keep in mind, the use of SEO is only a tactic. The content of the website should be the key to draw visitors's attention and their loyalty.



## Proposal
I only added very simple metadata for the site right now. If this is for a
future reference. The first thing I would work on is to build the connection with social medias. Sharing is the key. The social media tag is something I would
definitely be included into the website. A website with the social media tag is more trustworthy to me personally. It sends a message that it cares about the users interaction. Secondly, I would use the header as a function to make the code clean, it is a meta tag but also uses in the HTML.


Also, I would use the style in metainfo/head, it makes the code much more clean,
and easier to use. For example, to use it in default.vue, and it will  be apply to all the pages.  Same for the link, we can use it as the stylesheet.
